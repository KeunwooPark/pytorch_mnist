# Pytorch Mnist Practice Code(For Starters)
This code is almost same with pytorch mnist example(https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py)

One thing I added is comments for the starters. When I saw the pytorch example code, there were many things that I didn't understood. So I had to search for them. I added those references that I found in the comments.  

I also added Tensorboard logger from here(https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/04-utils/tensorboard/logger.py)
